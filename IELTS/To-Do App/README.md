# IELTS-To-Do-ReactJS

A simple to-do list web application based in React and Javascript designed to carry out normal daily tasks.

I have built this application as a internship first round task for IELTS PROFICENCY.

The name of the app is Defnote. It is my gamer tag name and I have done all of this project on my own.

The only references I have had in the task is the internet for some tags & clauses.
