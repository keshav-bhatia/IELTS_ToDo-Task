# IELTS_ToDo-Task
A web app based on ReactJS + ExpressJS with Login functionality, dashboard page, and manage profile page.
This repository has 2 folders inside the IELTS folder. One is the main folder which has the login page for the website and the second one is the to-do app.
These are both linked but I have mentioned them separately in different folders so you can get a quick demo of the work I have done, otherwise it is a long process to test out everything as you will have to first install all the npm modules, then start the React server and after that login through the page, create your ID and then only you can get the full access to the To-do app.
